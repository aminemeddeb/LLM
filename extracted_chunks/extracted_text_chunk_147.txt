the first category CHACHA20 POLY1305 a combination of two algorithms designed to be efficient when imple mented in software and AESOCB have been added to the previously considered competitors the second group instead saw the inclusion of both the authentication only variant of CHACHA20POLY1305 and the HMAC algorithm combined with the widespread SHA256 cryptographic hash function Figure 57 shows the results of the benchmark in case of the x86 processor where AESGCM and its GMAC variant emerge as clear winners in both categories Instead considering the re sults obtained with the embedded system shown in figure 58 it is evident
