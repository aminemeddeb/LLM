allows developers to associate to each one a specific security level which selects the cryptographic function used to protect the actual messages transmitted across the network De pending on the criticality of each service different levels of security may be suitable considering again a balance between protection and computational complexity which may fruitlessly increase the latency and saturate the physical device Three different security levels are provided by the designed framework respectively denominated nosecauthentication andconfidentiality which are analyzed in the following 411 Nosec Thenoseclevel is the simplest one which merely corresponds to vanilla SOMEIP While not providing any security guarantee
