RAM and executing an embedded Linux distribution built through Yocto Project6 As an effort in trying to further reduce possible interferences CPU scaling func tionalities have been temporarily disabled on both systems and other applications or unnecessary background tasks terminated Each benchmark has been executed ten times specifying as a parameter the number of iterations for the main loop of each algorithm selected as a treadoff to achieve good precision while limiting the execution time 100 000and1000repetitions have been chosen respectively for symmetric and asymmetric algorithms in case of the x86 device while they have been reduced by ten and
