Future Work During this thesis work a security framework integrated within SOMEIP has been conceived to protect the communications between invehicle services Although different wellestablished protocols do already exist to prevent attacks to network transmissions in the broader ICT world the challenging environment dictated by the automotive sector and the desire for a futureproof solution pushed the research towards a new approach After an initial analysis SOMEIP emerged as a promisingcommunicationframework drivenbydynamismandorientedtowardshigh bandwidth and computationally demanding applications Albeit comprising a wide range of functionalities no reference to cybersecurity is made inside the framework specifications leaving the transmitted information completely unprotected
