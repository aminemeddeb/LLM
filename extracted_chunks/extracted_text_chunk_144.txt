five times each for the less powerful ARMbased board The results have been postprocessed by means of a custom script to compute for each library algorithm and size the average execution time tand the corresponding standard deviation t calculated according to equation 51 finally the throughput 6httpswwwyoctoprojectorg 475 PoC Implementation value has been derived together with the associated standard deviation and plotted for easier comparison tN i1tit2 N51 514 Results evaluation Considering the results depicted in figures 51 to 56 it emerges at a first glance the huge difference in terms of performance between the laptop with a x86 processor
