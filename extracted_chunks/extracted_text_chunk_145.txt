and the ARM based embedded system which justifies the considerations made during the design phase about the necessary tradeoffs to avoid the introduction of excessive overheads Looking more in detail at the different libraries and limiting the analysis to x86 benchmarks it emerges that both for what regards authenticated encryption and MAC algorithms OpenSSL and LibreSSL achieve similar throughputs except in few cases where the former tends to be more optimized Botan and CryptoPP instead are characterized by performance limited in most situations to less than one half the ones provided by the competitors Finally considering asymmetric algorithms OpenSSL is
