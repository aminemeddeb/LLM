embedded systems with possibly limited computational capabilities it becomes fundamental to select an efficient and highly optimized implementation to avoid the introduction of unnecessary performance penalties Secondly while the subsequent PoC development has been driven by the usage of abstractions hiding as much as possible lowlevel details the selected cryptography library is a so important building block that guiding some architectural choices becomes with no doubt difficult to be replaced at a later stage The initial decision about a specific algorithm on the other hand is certainly less fundamental being possible to provide multiple 445 PoC Implementation implementations and let
