possible any possible factor of interference stopping all unnecessary background tasks and executing ten times every benchmark It is worth pointing out that especially for measurements adopting an asynchronous pattern causing the transmission of high quantities of data in limited time it has been necessary to tweak some operating system parameters related to the size of UDP buffers to prevent the loss of packets due to saturation At the end of the benchmarking phase the obtained results have been post processed to compute the average values among the repeated executions together with the associated uncertainties Moreover a comparison with respect
