phase and ana lyzing the obtained results a brief discussion about the cryptography algorithms chosen for the comparison is provided In order to see the overall picture a com mon subset of candidates provided by all the libraries and belonging to the three categories exploited by the security framework has been identified by considering wellestablished and widespread competitors For a fair comparison moreover the same security strength corresponding to 128 bits has been considered in every case5by adapting the key length according to the characteristics of the algorithms The first investigated grouping embraces authenticated encryption the class of algorithms belonging
