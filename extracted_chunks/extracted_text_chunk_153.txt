set of functionalities which are briefly analyzed in the following 521 Cryptography abstraction Being the depicted solution highly based on cryptography a quite significant number of classes has been designed to abstract the various functionalities decoupling as much as possible the interface from the actual implementation which is clearly based on the APIs provided by OpenSSL Considering symmetric cryptography for example two different interfaces have been designed abstracting respectively the concepts of authenticated encryption and authenticationonly They allow the transparent coexistence of multiple im plementations based on different algorithms hiding specific and lowlevel aspects Moreover every derived class may choose
