to the symmetric cryptography branch that are used to guaranteedataauthentication integrityandconfidentiality Twodifferentcandidates have been considered for this initial evaluation AESCCM and AESGCM they are both modes of operation combined with the ubiquitous Advanced Encryption Standard AES block cipher that can operate with data of any size Secondly algorithms computing Message Authentication Codes have been taken into account due to their usage in protecting communications of services operating atauthentication level In this category the two selected candidates are represented by the authenticationonly variants of the ones chosen for the previous category which are used without feeding data to be encrypted Finally
