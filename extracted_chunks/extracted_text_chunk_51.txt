SOMEIP messages that fit directly into an unfragmented IP packet the maximum allowed payload size has been arbitrarily fixed to 1400 bytes considering the Ethernet Maximum Transmission Unit MTU equal to 1500 bytes and leaving some extra space to allow for future changes to the protocol stack eg changing to IPv6 or adding security means To permit the delivery of bigger messages over UDP a protocol extension named SOMEIP Transport Protocol 15 has been standardized by the same consortium it implements the message fragmentation concept directly within the framework by providing the possibility of splitting extrasized payloads in multiple parts
