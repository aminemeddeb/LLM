of interference the core instructions are executed repeatedly within a loop and the total elapsed time is considered in the throughput computation moreover all plaintexts are generated in advance and initialization vectors if necessary are kept fixed during all the different iterations To represent various message sizes functions are executed with four different values for the plaintext length which are deemed to be quite representative 16 bytes 5Actually this statement is not true for what regards RSA that if a 2048 bits key is used as in this case provides only 112 bitsof equivalent security nonetheless the obtained results are
