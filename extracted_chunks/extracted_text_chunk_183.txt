It aimed at measuring the extra latencies introduced by the additional security functionalities that being highly based on cryptographic functions are with no doubt computationally expensive In particular the attention turned to the runtime protection evaluating the penalties associated to each security level to understand whether they are bearable or not in critical and constrained environments like the automotive one In the following the benchmark methodology is firstly introduced to continue with the analysis of the results 621 Benchmark methodology In order to perform the necessary measurements two applications clearly based on the framework under analysis have been developed to
