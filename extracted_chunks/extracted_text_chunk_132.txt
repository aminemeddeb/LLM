of the configuration options is presented to show how it is possible to both specify the level at which each service instance operates and configure the broad range of security parameters influencing the behavior of the implementation under discussion 51 Cryptography Before starting the actual implementation of the conceived solution within the vsomeip framework an analysis about the different available possibilities for the computation of the necessary cryptographic functions has been carried on for two main reasons On one side being the designed security protocol deeply based on the usage of cryptographic algorithms and the target of the conceived solution
