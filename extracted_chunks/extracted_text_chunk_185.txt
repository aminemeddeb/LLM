logic depicted in listing 61 which adopts a synchronous approach after having sent a request to the server in fact the corresponding response is awaited before proceeding with the next iteration of the loop This way the measured round trip time comprises the elapsed time from the very beginning of the request to the reception of the response including both the latencies introduced by the framework and the ones due to the transmission across the network As always to reduce the variabilities and obtain more consistent results the process is repeated within a loop and the total elapsed time is
