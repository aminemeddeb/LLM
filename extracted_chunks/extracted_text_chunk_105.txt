for what regards the server and the client the former performs an explicitauthenti cation by signing the response with its own private key while the latter is implicitly authenticated since it needs to use its private key to decipher the transferred symmetric key Symmetric key transfer to let the client in case the authentication suc ceeds to acquire the secret key necessary for the subsequent communication it is a clearly critical task since in case an attacker obtained the cryptographic material the protection for the whole service would be lost To avoid being accessed by malicious parties the symmetric key
