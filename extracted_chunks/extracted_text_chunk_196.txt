of the proof of concept Considering greater security levels on the other hand latencies introduced by cryptographic functions become a bit more evident although still remaining confined in the 15 to20 band Moving the attention towards CPU usage it emerges an opposite trend with respect to the previous case due to the limitations imposed by the security measures replay protection in fact prevents the concurrent authentication of multiple messages belonging to the same service instance slightly reducing the maximum exploitable parallelism Obtained results are mostly confirmed also by the second plot shown in figure 62 while the average round trip
