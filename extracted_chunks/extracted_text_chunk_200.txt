variation so pronounced it greatly influences all the considerations about the PoC implementation While in case of local communications in fact security functionalities do introduce additional latencies accounting for about one third of the total round trip time the same differences are almost negligible if packets flow across Ethernet Similarly although in the first situation the CPU load is certainly noteworthy considering the 50 limit due to the execution of two applications at the same time the second one shows an almost completely idle processor Finally considering the results concerning notificationbased communications depicted in figure 65 no evident differences can
