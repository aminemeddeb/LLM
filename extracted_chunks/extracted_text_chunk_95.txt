across the transmissive medium An approach similar to the one adopted by the widespread Transport Layer Security TLS protocol made up of an initial handshake phase for session estab lishment followed by subsequent message transmissions has been chosen during the design This decision which provides a clear separation of roles between the two phases originates from the need for the usage of different cryptographic techniques asymmetric algorithms to authenticate the applications and verify whether they are allowed to offer or request specific services and symmetric cryptography to limit the computational time required when a packet has to be sent out
