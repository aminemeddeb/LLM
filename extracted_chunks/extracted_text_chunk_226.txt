amounts of traffic and neglecting network overheads additional latencies never exceeded unsustainable thresholds Anyway additional measurements should still be performed both to quantify the overheads introduced by the initial session establishment phase and to explore the possibility of exploiting available hardware accelerators to fatherly reduce the penalties especially in case of more limited embedded systems As a future work the designed security protocol could be reviewed by means of formal analysis to verify the correctness and guarantee the absence of faults moreover known limitations shall be examined in great detail to conceive possible solutions In particular for what regards the
