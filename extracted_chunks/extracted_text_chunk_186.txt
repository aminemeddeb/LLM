considered for the final computation the number of iterations varies according to the specific situation to obtain a good compro mise between precision and execution time Secondly an asynchronous approach is adopted by waiting for the reception of the responses only at the end of all iterations Although the measured quantity does not strictly correspond to a round 626 Experimental Evaluation Listing 61 Synchronous requestresponse benchmark function 1function rttbenchmarkpayloadsize iterations 2begin body 3 request createrequestpayloadsize 4 5 starttime now 6 for ifrom 1toiterations 7 sendrequestrequest 8 waitresponse 9 end for 10 endtime now 11 12 printrttstarttime endtime iterations 13 end
