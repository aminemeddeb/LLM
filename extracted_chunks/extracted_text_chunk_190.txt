has been kept in mind by repeating the measurements with different payload lengths ranging from 1 byteto1024 bytes which are deemed to be quite representative of actually used values only the requests are modified between one 636 Experimental Evaluation execution and the subsequent while acknowledges are always characterized by the absence of the payload Similarly to what already performed for the evaluation of cryptography libraries as explained in 513 measurements have been executed considering both a x86 based device and embedded systems equipped with ARM processors It is worth noting that for what regards the first case only the laptop
