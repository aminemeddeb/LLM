from access and modifications with relatively limited requirements in terms of computational power Its main limitation resides in the need for a key sharing phase which is clearly critical from the security point of view In the proposed solution symmetric cryptography algorithms are extensively used for message protection in case of services operating both at authentication andconfidentiality level The two main classes include 1It is clearly not possible to encrypt the header since its information must be accessed to complete the delivery nonetheless it is authenticated by the signature and therefore it is not possible for an attacker to modify
