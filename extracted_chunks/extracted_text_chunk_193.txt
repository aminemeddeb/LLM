to vanilla vsomeip has been extracted to point out the penalties introduced by the security modifications finally the results have been plotted for easier analysis 622 Results evaluation In the following the outcome of the different benchmarks is presented both for what regards the x86 system and the embedded devices All depicted graphs are organized in three parts Firstly the measured round trip time is presented followed by a direct comparison of each security level against vanilla vsomeip to highlight the differences Finally CPU usage measurements are plotted to verify whether correlations with the other values do exist x86 benchmarks
