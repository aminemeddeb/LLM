suffer from strong limitations due to the reduced computational power typical of microcontrollers and the challenging realtime needs characterizing this protocol Moving to more powerful systems and Ethernetbased communications the security of messages exchanged between remote devices has already been tackled by many researchers especially in the broader field of ICT networking Various protocol suites are in use today which approach the problem at different levels to guarantee the features required by the specific usecases Firstly security can be provided at the network layer of the ISOOSI stack by the IPSec protocol 10 which establishes secured tunnels between interconnected hosts
