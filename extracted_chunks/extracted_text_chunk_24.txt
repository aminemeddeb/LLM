the CAN bus is called Local Interconnect Network LIN It is designed to be as inexpensive as possible and can support up to 16 slave nodes which primarily just listen to the master device often connected to the CAN bus 102 Background The maximum speed of 20 kbpsmakes it useful only for very lowend peripheral systems 213 Automotive Ethernet While new applications are requiring every day more and more communication bandwidth to fulfill their requirements existing highspeed proprietary standards such as the MOST Protocol1and the FlexRay bus2 are arising new challenges due to the complexity in the implementation and the
