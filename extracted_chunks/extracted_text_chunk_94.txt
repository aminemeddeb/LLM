trusted authority and associates the publickey with the identity of its owner Public cryptography is characterized by being highly computational demanding and usable only with very limited amounts of data Within network protocols it is mainly used during an initial handshake phase to exchange the secret key later used for actual message protection and to authenticate the participants to the communication by computing digital signatures 43 Security protocol The core part of the conceived solution resides in the design of the security protocol which given in input the level associated to each service provides the actual protection to the messages
