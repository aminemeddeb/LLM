exploiting messages injected into the CAN network and the broadcast nature of the transmissive medium allowed the researchers to perform simple actions In particular two offenses aiming at opening the window lift when a specific condition was met and keeping the antitheft system off were based on flooding the network with malicious messages to cause message confliction which arises when the target ECU receives opposing information Different ECUs may react differently to this condition but usually simpler ones merely consider valid the last message received the attacks succeed even if legit messages which are periodically broadcast are not removed from
