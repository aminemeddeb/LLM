systems like braking and steering to computers algorithms and software Previous research demonstrated that many security flaws do exist in commer cially available vehicles due to the massive presence of software Network protocols designed without taking into proper account security design principles and applica tion bugs have been exploited by researchers to remotely take over the control of different vehicular systems without the possibility for the actual drivers to react The thesis originates from these problems and focuses on novel mechanisms and algorithms to provide improved security to the applications that are executed in the vehicle which are based on
