Implementation This chapter which presents the main insights about the implementation of the solution presented in chapter 4 is divided into three broad parts Firstly being cryptography the backbone of the conceived solution a comparison about different cryptographic libraries and algorithms corroborated by the results of performance measurements is proposed to justify the preliminary decisions took at the beginning of the implementation process Secondly a highlevel description of the modules developed within the vsomeip framework is presented to show the designed features that have been implemented as a proof of concept together with the main developed abstractions Finally an overview
