attr Implementation policy for this data object Tags xmlsequenceOffset230 swIntended ResolutionNumerical 01 attr The purpose of this element is to describe the requested quantization of data objects early on in the design process The resolution ultimately occurs via the conversion formula present compuMethod which specifies the transition from the physical world to the standardized world and viceversa here the slope per bit is present implicitly in the conversion formula In the case of a development phase without a fixed conversion formula a prespecification can occur through swIntendedResolution The resolution is specified in the physical domain according to the property unit Tags xmlsequenceOffset240 5 99 of 107 Document ID 660 AUTOSARSWSSOMEIPTransformerSpecification of

from the task in which write access processes to the variable run But this cannot be done by the MCD system So this attribute can be used in an early phase to express the desired refresh timing and later on to specify the real refresh timing Tags xmlsequenceOffset300 swTextProps SwTextProps 01 aggr the specific properties if the data object is a text object Tags xmlsequenceOffset120 swValueBlock
