Abstract Intrusion Detection Systems are widely used to
detect cyberattacks especially on protocols vulnerable to hacking
attacks such as SOMEIP In this paper we present a deep
learningbased sequential model for ofine intrusion detection
on SOMEIP application layer protocol To assess our intrusion
detection system we have generated and labeled a dataset1with
several classes representing realistic intrusions and a normal
class  a signicant contribution due to the absence of such
publicly available datasets Furthermore we also propose a
recurrent neural network RNN as an instance of deep learning
based sequential model that we apply to our generated dataset
The numerical results show that RNN excel at predicting in
vehicle intrusions with F1 Scores and AUC values greater than
08 depending on each intrusion type

I I NTRODUCTION
Automobiles are no longer solely made up of mechanical
systems In fact mechanical components have been taken
over by electronics called Electronic Control Units ECUs
These connected ECUs through various invehicle network
infrastructures CAN FlexRay MOST and LIN are in charge
of making various car functions possible However these
traditional invehicle networks have many limitations in terms
of bandwidth and higher layer protocols An adaptable and
scalable invehicle network technology is thus required to
realize sophisticated and innovative customer functions such
as Adaptive cruise control Collision avoidance Driver drowsi
ness detection Lane departure warning and others To fulll
these automotive requirements Automotive Ethernet tech
nologies have been developed and standardized
The deployment of Ethernetbased communication in in
vehicle network systems has several other benets such as
the ability to reuse the associated OSI layers protocols built
and tested in other industries 21 Furthermore this cutting
edge technology enables the invention of new protocols for
individual layers while reusing protocols for the rest such as
the development of the automotive application layer protocol

SOMEIP is commonly used for relevant automotive ap
plications due to its servicebased communication approach
and its adaptability to different automotive operating systems
eg QNX OSEK and Linux 21 In other words SOMEIP
is increasingly adopted to coordinate the exchange of various
services between disjoint applications on distinct ECUs These
services cover notications about invehicle events as well as
Remote Procedure Call RPC functions that enable an ECU
client to request information from an ECU server However
no security measures such as authentication or encryption are
dened in the SOMEIP protocol specication 3 In fact the
absence of SOMEIP security protocols may set the ground
for an attacker to exploit a legitimate automotive system and
initiate attacks from inside the network such as intercepting
and manipulating messages between two ECUs and other
signicant threats To reduce the risk of the various inherent
security threats a robust defense plan is needed which rst
requires detecting and analyzing these vulnerabilities
Due to their large approximation capacity deep learning
based approaches are wellsuited to detect network intrusions
in various network types 1 14 In this work we have devel
oped a deep learning based sequential model to detect network
intrusions on the SOMEIP protocol Sequential models are
a category of deep learning model where the training set
is known apriori to have a dominant temporal or causal
component indeed packets in a session of the SOMEIP
protocol exhibit a strong temporal correlation as each packet
depends on previous ones In the current work we will
contribute to the development of a sequencebased SOMEIP
dataset as no public SOMEIP dataset exists Specically
we generate and label a SOMEIP dataset with four classes
of general intrusion packets as well as a class of normal
packets Moreover our proposed deep learningbased model
a recurrent neural network RNN is able to classify these
four intrusions on packets sequences and the normal ones
with very large accuracy and F1 score Furthermore we will
evaluate our deep learningbased sequential model using thearXiv210808262v2  csCR  10 Oct 2021
 
generated dataset
Towards this end our paper is organized into six sections
Section 2 discusses main publications that are related to
SOMEIP intrusion detection In section 3 we present an
overview of the SOMEIP protocol In section 4 we present
our dataset and the different considered attacks The suggested
sequential model is presented in Section 5 In section 6 we
present the different evaluation metrics used for performance
evaluation We discuss our experimental results in section 7
Finally we conclude our paper with future work direction

II R ELATED WORK
Deep Learning approaches were highly used in previous
works to detect network intrusions on the traditional invehicle
network protocol CAN 10 11 12 14 However no
previous work has been addressed to detect intrusions on
Automotive Ethernet especially SOMEIP protocol using Deep
Learning due to the following reasons
Lack of Automotive Ethernet dataset The existence
of large CAN databases 13 containing both normal and
abnormal network trafc behaviour has resulted in ex
tensive research into deep learning applications on CAN
However SOMEIP application layer protocol does not
have wellknown dataset available Despite the fact that
a new Automotive Ethernet dataset is recently published
22 it is not helpful for our current work since it covers
normal and abnormal streams of audiovideo transport
protocol A VTP which is different than SOMEIP pro
tocol Thus the generation of the labeled dataset and its
publication is one but not the only contribution of the
current paper
Automotive Ethernet Standard gaining momentum
Automotive Ethernet a recent network protocol for ve
hicles is gaining increasing momentum in standards for
connected vehicles
In terms of SOMEIPs latest security vulnerability investi
gations researchers have begun to investigate its key vul
nerabilities that could lead to cyberattacks on the invehicle
network as well as to develop IDS using different approaches
Fig 2 Congured Network  Different SOMEIP clients and servers ex
changing SOMEIP services over Automotive Ethernet Bus Besides a Client
ECU is being compromised by an MITM Attacker
Gehrmann et al 5 addressed specic problems and op
portunities for intrusion detection in SOMEIP as well as
suggested an architecture for a SOMEIP intrusion detection
scheme and discussed its security features Iorio et al 6
7 proposed a novel architecture to enhance the security
of evolving SOMEIP middleware Li at al 16 developed
Ori a Greybox Fuzzer that can efciently detect breaches
in SOMEIP applications Lauser et al 9 have discussed
how formal models can be used to verify the security of
protocols used in modern vehicles Rumez et al 8 explained
various security countermeasures in the elds of rewalls
intrusion detection systems IDSs and identity and access
management Herold et al 3 proposed a rulebased IDS for
SOMEIP protocol
To the best of our knowledge none of the previous works
have applied deep learningbased sequential models for intru
sion detection on SOMEIP protocol That is a main contribu
tion of this work in addition to the generation of the labeled
dataset with multiple classes of intrusions and a normal class
III O VERVIEW OF SOMEIP
AMiddleware refers to a connective tissue between
different software applications In other words it handles
all functions that are needed for a service to allow data
exchange between several ECUs 21 Due to the growing
amount of software 17 in automobiles as well as the
spread of functions within their invehicle network and the
deployment of a variety of software architectures and operating
systems inside vehicles the implementation of a middleware
software within invehicle networks is essential in bridging the
gap between them Hence after being proposed by the BMW
Group in 2011 and standardized by AUTOSAR SOMEIP
was chosen as the standard middleware for IPbased service
oriented communication in cars The middleware SOMEIP
runs at top levels of the OSI model 5 The structure of
its header layout is as shown in Figure 1 Some of the
elds presented in the header of the SOMEIP packet will
 
Fig 3 Attacks on SOMEIP protocol
be considered in our work as the input features for the deep
learning based IDS Table IV
A SOMEIP Remote Procedure Calls
Since SOMEIP is a servicebased communication ap
proach it allows the exchange of different types of remote
procedure calls In general a remote procedure call RPC is an
interprocess communication technique that is used for client
server based applications 15 In this current work we have
considered three main types of SOMEIP RPC 
RequestResponse  a method with Request and Response
messages The Request is a message sent by the client
when it invokes a method The Response is a message
sent from the server to the client that contains the method
invocations outcome
Fire and Forget  a procedure that only uses Request
messages As in the RequestResponse scenario the
client calls a server method However unlike in the
RequestResponse instance the client does not anticipate
a response
Events  In this method the server sends messages to the
client with particular information either periodically or
whenever there is a change event The server expects
no response from the client

IV G ENERATING LABELED DATASET
A Dataset Generation
1 SOMEIP packet generator In order to generate
SOMEIP libpcap dump les we have used the SOMEIP
Generator developed by 3 implemented in Python 3 and
available in Github 4 The generator models the behavior ofdifferent clients and servers assumed to behave according to
the AUTOSAR standard specication as well as an attacker
carrying out a variety of attacks depicted in Figure 3 and
described in section IVA3 As seen in Figure 4 and Table II
we have tuned the different parameters for generating different
attack scenarios such as the network architecture conguration
depicted in Figure 2 the SOMEIP services to be exchanged
and the attack to be implemented along with its frequency of
execution For training and testing our deep learning based
IDS we have generated several pcap les corresponding
to different attack types concatenated them and processed
them as described in section IVA4 The distributions of both
datasets are shown in Table I and their corresponding features
are described in Table IV The training dataset comprises about
274 attacks is 132 MB in size and contains 2807 packets
Regarding the testing dataset it contains around 300 attacks
has a size of 130 MB and composed of 2771 packets Readers
can get our SOMEIP intrusion dataset by referring to 24
Fig 4 Dataset Generation
2 Dataset Imbalance As seen in table I the distribution of
samples across the different classes is biased In fact the attack
classes frequency is highly imbalanced ie there is a bias or
skewness towards the majority class Normal class present
in the target It is reasonable to have such a skewed dataset

since it represents an anomaly problem However we do not
aim changing the nature of the data and make it balanced
even though this problem poses a challenge for predictive
modeling as most of the supervised deep learning algorithms
used for classication were designed around the assumption
of an equal number of examples for each class An alternative
solution would be the adoption of specialized techniques such
asAdaptive Weighting 25 This technique implemented in
our work is considered as a popular approach for imbalance
learning since it weighs samples in rare classes with high cost
and then applies costsensitive learning methods to deal with
imbalance in classes Table III presents the weights assigned

3 SOMEIP intrusions The SOMEIP attacker is able to
compromise a known device within the system Thus it has a
valid MAC address IP address and service ID It eavesdrops
on all trafc within the network and send packets to all
clients and all servers and thus impersonates other SOMEIP
devices and services 3 Through our work we are interested
in cyberattacks which lead to deviations from the protocol
specications in a communication session between two devices
as seen in Figure 3 and which can be detected using deep
learning based sequential Models These four intrusion types
considered in this work are detailed below illustrated also in
Figure 3
Requests without Response  Requests have to be an
swered with either a response or an error message If
a request was never answered it means that an attacker
has relayed the communication between the client and the
server who believe that they are directly communicatingTABLE IV
DATASET FEATURES

Service ID A unique identier for a service
Method IDA unique identier of a method
an event or a eld that belong to the service
Client IDAllows a server to differentiate
calls from multiple clients to the same method
Message TypeUsed to differentiate different types of messages
such as  requestrequest no return
notication response and error
Session IdAllows a subscriber to differentiate multiple
calls to the same method
Interface Version Contains the Major Version of the Service Interface
Protocol Version Contains the SOMEIP protocol version
Return CodeUsed to signal whether a request
was successfully processed
IP source IP of the sending device
IP destination IP of the receiving device
Protocol Application layer protocol
Source Port Port number of the sending device
Destination Port Port number of the receiving device
Mac source MAC Address of the sending device
Mac destination MAC Address of the receiving device
LabelSpecies the class of each packet such as normal
error on error error on event request without
response response without request
with each other
Response without Request  A response should only be
delivered in response to an open previous request As a
result a normal request with message type 0x00 should
be answered by a single response with message type
0x80 Two replies to a single request break the protocol
and may indicate the existence of an attacker attempting
to impersonate the server and injecting extra packets
Error on Error  Based on AUTOSAR standard speci
cation an error message should not be answered with
another error message Hence an incoming error which
doesnt have a corresponding request or other packet
with the same settings indicates the presence of a network
intrusion
Error on Event  Notications should not be answered
with an error message Thus a notication replied to with
 
an error depicts a network intrusion between the client
and the server
4 Data Preparation This section describes the different
steps seen in Figure 4 achieved for our dataset to be fed to
our deep learning based IDS for training and testing
1Packets generation and labeling The SOMEIP
packet generator is able to generate pcap les composed
of unlabeled packets gathered from the whole network
Since we are using a supervised learning approach we
had to label each packet Hence a packet is labeled by
0 if it behaves according to the AUTOSAR standard
specication Otherwise it is labeled by 123 or 4
if it represents error on event error on error request
without response or response without request attacks
respectively
2Packets Feature Extraction and OneHot Encoding
Each packet is represented by 16 categorical features
described in Table IV However these features had to
be converted to binary vectors using onehot encoding
technique In fact many deep learning algorithms cannot
work with categorical data directly Hence the cate
gories must be converted into numbers This is required
for both input and output variables that are categorical
After encoding the 15 features that represented input
variables were extended to 195 features and the output
variable Label was extended to 5 classes
3Grouping Packets into Sequences In order to detect
intrusions affecting the communication behavior be
tween two devices we had to group packets that belong
to each communication in their appropriate sequence
Hence each sequence represents a series of ordered
packets exchanged between a client and a server with
the same session identier As seen in Figure 4 we
have grouped packets in their corresponding sequences
Thus our IDS will detect the presence of an intrusion
in a communication between a client and a server by
inspecting each sequence of packets However since
we are dealing with variable length sequence prediction
problems our data had be transformed such that each
sequence has the same length Hence after transfor
mation each sequence contains 60 packets which is
the maximum number of packets per sequence ie a
sequence is padded by zeros if it contains less than
60 packets per session Our dataset was generated with
the constraints that only one type of attack can occur
between two devices Therefore sequences are either
labeled as normal or by a number corresponding to only
one of the four possible intrusions Furthermore an
attack begins and ends in the same session between a
client and a server Hence an attack cannot be executed
in different sessions at the same time
4Sequences Concatenation Finally after labeling the
different sequences that represent diverse attacks we
have concatenated them in a single dataset that will used
for training and testing the deep learning based IDSV P ROPOSED SEQUENTIAL MODEL
Fig 5 RNN based IDS architecture
Deep Learning based sequential models have been widely
adopted to detect intrusions and anomalies in various type
of computer networks 18 19 20 Our proposal in this
section is to employ Recurrent Neural Networks or RNN as
a sequential model to the labeled dataset generated in the
previous section The proposed RNN is presented in Figure
5 Furthermore its resulting hyperparameters are shown in
Table V The input to the RNN consists of 60 ordered packets
with 195 features each It passes to two stacked RNN layers
which have recurrent connections between hidden units The
two RNN layers read the entire input sequence of 60 packets
and feed their output to a dense layer which produces 5
outputs corresponding to each the 5 classes using softmax
function We denote the training set fxtytgT

whether the corresponding feature vector xt belongs ie

VI E VALUATION METRICS
We use the Area Under The Curve AUC values Receiver
Operating Characteristics ROC curves and F1 scores and
calculate them for each class to assess our IDS performance
We also present the multiclass confusion matrices which
contains information about the actual and prediction classica
tions done by the classier to describe the performance of the
multiclassier models The training samples corresponding to
the label ground truth yt are represented by each row of
the matrix whereas the occurrences in a predicted label yt
RNN output are represented by each column Specically
for the task at hand the confusion matrix will be a 55
where element ij2 f15gf 15gdenotes the
normalized number of occurrences  where the true label is
from classi2f15g and the predicted label is from class
j2f15g Thus for an ideal multiclass classier all the
diagonal entries should be 1 while the offdiagonal entries
should be 0
In addition to the confusion matrix we use the following
other metrics
Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observa
tions of all the observations in the actual class
Recall TP
TPFN5
Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observa
tions of all the observations in the predicted class
Precision TP
TPFP6
Hence the F1Score is calculated using the following equa
tion
F1Score 2PrecisionRecall
Precision Recall7Where TP  True Positive FP  False Positive TN  True
Negative FN  False Negative
Since the dataset is imbalanced the F1 score which is
the weighted average results of both metrics precision and
recall is essential for evaluating the deep learning based IDS
performance The model has a large predictive power if the
F1 score is near to 10
The receiver operating characteristic curve or ROC curve is
a graphical representation of a classier systems performance
while its discrimination threshold is modied It is calculated
by displaying the true positive rate TPR vs the false positive
rate FPR at different threshold levels The ideal classier
should provide a point in the upper left corner of the ROC
space or coordinate 01 signifying 100 percent sensitivity
no false negatives and 100 percent specicity no false
positives AUC stands for Area under the ROC Curve It
measures the entire twodimensional area underneath the entire
ROC curve The AUC for an ideal classier should be 1
In the experiments we use the Python library Keras 2 to
implement our RNN model We train and evaluate our model
on an IntelR CoreTM i56440HQ CPU  260GHz
VII R ESULTS
Using the generated dataset we ran a threefold cross
validation with early stopping to ensure a large statistical
condence for our models prediction performance In each
crossvalidation 67 and 33 of the data are chosen at
random as the training and validation sets respectively The
training set is used for model tting and the validation set
is used for model evaluation for each of the hyperparameter
sets Furthermore they have the same proportion of classes
in each validation fold After crossvalidation we got three
trained RNN models To assess the overall performance of
our approach we ran three experiments on the testing dataset
one for each trained model

The classication results for threefold crossvalidation are
shown in Table VI The experimental results demonstrated that
the model performed well with acceptable F1score values for
each class of the validation folds Thus the models can classify

almost all type of attacks on sequences correctly Moreover
no signicant difference in performance metrics exists across
the three crossvalidations As a result the training process is
robust with the selected hyperparameters
Figure 6 show a summary of prediction results on the 3 folds
for the multiclassication intrusion detection problem during
crossvalidation The models have few prediction errors as
values outside the diagonal of the confusion matrices approach
zero Hence the models have well performed since most of the
samples are located in the diagonal of the confusion matrices
Figure 8 presents the ROC curves and AUC values for each
attack type and for each model microROC and macroROC
curves during the threefold crossvalidation The displayed
gures has AUC values near 1 which means the 3 modelshave a good measure of separability for the different attack
types Furthermore the different roc curves have a point in the
upper left corner or coordinate 01 of the ROC space for each
model representing the ability of the model to have a a huge
sensitivity no false negatives and an outstanding specicity
no false positives We have then performed three tests using
the three models that were trained during the crossvalidation
on the testing dataset Based on the results shown in Table
VII Figure 7 and 9 we found that the overall performance
of the models is outstanding In fact the trained models were
able to generalize to data that they havent seen before and did
not merely learn to model the training data In average the
model has well predicted the normal behavior of packets in a
sequence F1score 099 It is also able to predict the several

are closer to the topleft corner and the AUC values for the

VIII L IMITATIONS
Our main contribution in this paper is to prove that deep
learning algorithms are suitable for detecting intrusions on
SOMEIP protocol and classifying them Hence our developed
intrusion detection system is considered as an attack classier
rather than an anomaly detector However for future work
we aim to develop an anomaly based IDS able to detect
any type of abnormal behavior and which can be trained
using unsupervised learning Furthermore the dataset used
for developing the proposed IDS is synthetic and has been
processed for ofine intrusion detection ie an intrusion is
detected when the session between a client and a server ends
However for future work we will be developing a intrusion
detection system used for realtime detection and trained using
an extracted dataset from real vehicle
IX C ONCLUSION
SOMEIP is an automotiveembedded communication pro
tocol which enhances intercommunication between several
ECUs In this paper we have proposed a deep learning basedIDS that can be leveraged to detect intrusions on SOMEIP au
tomotive protocol We have generated a labeled dataset to train
and evaluate the performance of our model in ofine mode and
made it public for reproducibility Performance results show
that the proposed models can be successfully implemented
to detect multiple types of intrusions on SOMEIP protocol
with very large F1Scores and AUC values bigger than 08
for each class For future work we aim to create a SOMEIP
packetbased dataset extracted from a real vehicle and test
diverse unsupervised learning based IDS that can be deployed
for detecting unknown intrusions in realtime
