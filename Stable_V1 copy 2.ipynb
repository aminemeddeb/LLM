      "\n",
      "in deep SOME/IP is basically an automotive /embedded protocol which supports remote procedure calls, event notifications and the underlying serialization/wire format.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Interface of SOME/IP is done in a specific interface language, “Franca”.\n",
      "\n",
      "For Android, SOME/IP plays an important role in connecting functionality from the BaseContainer(NodeX) into the Android Container, as well as providing boardnetsignals (Pure SOME/IP and Gates CN Signals) to the Android HALS. All communication within the Android Container is handled via the binder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q. Why SOME/IP is required in Automotive Domain?\n",
      "\n",
      "with time, Automotive Technology is growing and its a need for a wider range of bandwidth requirements. here we can consider the Application that provides navigation via GPS, real-time traffic updates etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "here ethernet is the best fit considering the changing communication requirements of the ECU both within the vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the ethernet needed a middleware solution to transport control data in Automotive.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these needs, SOME/IP was created.\n",
      "• Serialization — transforming into and from on-wire representation.\n",
      "• Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Messaging—implementing remote invocation of functions as well as other messages.\n",
      "• Service Discovery (SD) — dynamically finding and functionality and configuring its access.\n",
      "• Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) — dynamically configuring which data is needed and shall be sent to the client.\n",
      "• Segmentation of UDP messages — allowing the transport of large SOME/IP messages over UDP without the need for fragmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOME/IP serialization was designed to be highly efficient; i.e. it uses minimal RAM and CPU resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is achieved by using a binary and non-descriptive format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, all parameters are written behind each other. The format of a message is very similar or in many cases exactly the same as the in-memory representation of the message (packed struct).\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP can serialize the following basic datatypes (datatypes are encoded per default in network byte order/big endian but can also be encoded in little endian):\n",
      "• boolean: an 8-bit field encoding False (0) or True (1). All other values are not allowed to be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP can serialize the following complex data types:\n",
      "• struct: a parameter that combines a predefined list of parameters. A struct can start with an optional length field counting all bytes of the struct following the length field.\n",
      "• string: fixed length or dynamic length character strings transporting ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16 characters. For dynamic length strings, the string starts with a big-endian encoded length field counting the bytes the string characters use.\n",
      "• array: a parameter that contains a repetition of the same parameter type. This can be a predefined number or a dynamic number of parameters. For arrays with dynamic length, a length field is used.\n",
      "• enumeration: a unit with the option of naming different values.\n",
      "• bitfield: 8, 16, or 32bit parameter, with each bit representing a boolean. Each boolean can have a name as well as a name for the True and False values.\n",
      "• union: a parameter that can carry a parameter of a predefined parameter type, which is determined at the runtime. Serialization uses a length field, type field, and the data of the parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of length and type fields is 32-bit (default) and be configured to be 0, 8, 16, or 32-bit. All length and type fields are encoded in network byte order/big-endian.\n",
      "• Request/Response Methods: A request is sent from a client to the server and a response is sent back from the server to the client. Additionally, SOME/IP allows error responses to be sent back from the server to the client instead of the regular response. This feature might be used to implement a different payload format in error cases.\n",
      "• Fire and Forget Methods: A request is sent from a client to the server.\n",
      "• Event: An event is sent from the server to relevant clients. Which client needs this event will be determined via SOME/IP-SD.\n",
      "• Field: A field can have an option notifier (event to be sent cyclically or on-change), an optional setter (a request/response method to update the field), and an optional getter (a request/response method to read out the current value of the field.)\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP already supports a lot of flexibility in the serialization of messages, like adding parameters to messages or inside structs later.\n",
      "\n",
      "A proprietary extension (wrongly called a TLV extension at first) was added to SOME/IP in later AUTOSAR releases to support even more flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, parameters and/or struct members can be prefixed with a Data ID and Length Indication. While this makes the serialization much less efficient, it adds flexibility, like removing parameters from messages or reordering parameters later.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use this feature, APIs and applications need to support this too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the limited flexibility and the high overhead, this extension is currently NOT widely used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that not all SOME/IP implementation support this extension since it's not part of the original SOME/IP.\n",

SOME/IP nodes are able to dynamically discover and subscribe to available services through the SOME/IP Service Discovery protocol (SOME/IP SD). In this context, a key performance criterion to achieve the required responsiveness is the subscription latency that is the time it takes for a client to subscribe to a service. In this paper we provide a recap of SOME/SD and list a number of assumptions based on what we can foresee about the use of SOME/IP in the automotive domain. Then, we identify the factors having an effect on the subscription latency, and, by sensitivity analysis, quantify their importance regarding the worst-case service subscription latency. The analysis and experiments in this study provide practical insights into how to best configure SOME/IP SD protocol.</div></div>\n",

      "\u001b[33mcleaned_text : \u001b[0m SOME/IP and DDS both allow distributed applications to communicate using both the publish/subscribe pattern and the service request/reply pattern (RPC). But there are also significant differences.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP was specifically designed for the automotive industry. SOME/IP is a collection of specifications developed as part of AUTOSAR that describe its serialization protocol, service discovery, and a transformer for integration with Classic AUTOSAR.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDS (Data Distribution Service) targets the broader Industrial IoT domain. It is a family of open standards published by the Object Management Group (OMG). It was specifically designed for distributed real-time systems, and is used in many industries including transportation, energy, medical systems, industrial automation, aerospace and defense, etc. There are many independent implementations both commercial and open source. The first specification in the DDS family was released in 2004 and since then has grown to a set of 12 DDS standards, which include a standard wire-protocol (DDS-RTPS), APIs (DDS-PSM-CXX, DDS-PSM-JAVA and the mappings from IDL to C, Ada , etc.) a type system (DDS-XTYPES), data delivery patterns (DDS for data-centric publish-subscribe and DDS-RPC for request-reply), security (DDS-SECURITY), system description (DDS-XML), data modeling (IDL), and gateways to other communication frameworks (DDS-WEB, DDS-OPCUA and DDS-XRCE).\n",
      "\n",
      "Technically and conceptually there are many differences, so I organized them into separate categories:\n",
      "• Use from other specifications\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP can be seen as an object-based Service-oriented Architecture. Information is provided to the system by instantiating service objects, these are accessed by client applications who instantiate corresponding “proxy” objects for each service instance they want to access. Client applications subscribe to information by attaching a Proxy Object to the Service Object and using it to monitor the events and field changes. They can also invoke operations on the service object to perform remote procedure calls or read/write specific fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDS fundamentally provides a decoupled, data-centric publish subscribe model. Aso referred as a “databus” pattern. Applications participate in the DataBus a peers and can publish/subscribe any data (identified by the DDS-Topic name) as well as invoke or implement any service operation (identified by the DDS-Service name). DDS is fully peer-to-peer -- it does not require any brokers in the middle. There is a discovery mechanism that continually runs to detect compatible publisher and subscriber applications that reference the same Topic name; as soon as they are detected they start exchanging information directly. Subscribers applications can specify filters (content or time-based) to indicate the information that they want to receive. Firtering can occur on the publisher side to reduce the information that goes on the wire.\n",
      "\n",
      "A significant difference between DDS and SOME/IP is that with DDS an application does not need to bind to specific implementations of services. It simple references the Topics and Services and it may communicate one-to-one or one-to-many fully transparently without any changes to application code. It does need to track the presence of separate peers or manage any new objects in response to peers joining or leaving. It is all handled automatically. In this sense it is much more dynamic than SOME/IP.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP does not define a standard API, implementations typically provide a C++ API but they are not portable across implementations. However typically SOME/IP is used as part of AUTOSAR, which does define some standard APIs.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDS has standard APIs for several languages. For C++ and Java, these are included in the DDS-PSM-JAVA and DDS-PSM-CXX specifications. The standard C and ADA APIs are derived from the IDL to C and ADA specifications. On top of that there vendor-specific APIs for C# and other languages. Therefore it is generally possible to port DDS applications and switch between DDS implementations.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP supports both UDP and TCP for data transmission. AUTOSAR 4.3 introduced support for segmentation of payloads bigger than 1400 bytes over UDP. For reliable communication, SOME/IP falls back to TCP.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDS used a a wire protocol called RTPS (Real-Time Publish Subscribe), which is defined in a platform-independent model that can be mapped to different network transport protocols. Most DDS (DDS-RTPS) implementations support at least, UDP, TCP, and shared memory. RTPS implements a transport-agnostic reliability and fragmentation protocol, which runs on top of any transport, including UDP with multicast. So with DDS it is possible to do large data and reliable data over multicast UDP. SOME/IP cannot do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many DDS implementations provide a “custom transport” SDK, so it is possible to run DDS over your own custom transport without sacrificing any of the capabilities and QoS. This is not possible with SOME/IP as certain features (like reliability and fragmentation) have to be implemented by the Transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally speaking SOME/IP also relies on the transport for security. So to use it securely it becomes required to run on TLS or DTLS.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also possible to run DDS over TLS or DTLS as transports, but this is not the preferred solution. Rather, with DDS it is best to use the mechanisms defined in the DDS Security specification, which are transport-agnostic. DDS security also provides much finer-grained control over security and a language to do access control, so it becomes possible to separately protect DDS Domains and Topics, and differentiate between read and write permissions to a Topic. Also since DDS security is transport agnostic it can be used with any transport including shared memory, multicast or a custom application-defined transport.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP only offers one the “reliability” Qos setting used to select UDP versus TCP. Anything else would have to be implemented with custom application-logic which, depending on the QoS policy, can be very hard. Also application-layer code is not so portable and requires all applications to include that same code or at least link a common non-standard library.\n",
      "\n",
      "DDS provides a number of QoS policies that enable users to specify declaratively how information is exchanged between publishers and subscribers. The DDS standard defines more than 20 separate policies. These policies control not only reliability, but other aspects such as resource usage, data prioritization, data availability and failover. For example, QoS settings provide the ability to establish deadlines to provide notifications if a publisher or a subscriber application fails to send or deliver information at a certain rate; setup durability of the data so that it can be retransmitted to subscriber applications who join after the information was produced and sent; configure the history depth of the publisher and subscriber applications; deploy redundant systems that automatically select one source among many based on ownership strength, configure automatic liveliness messages to determine whether remote applications are still alive and perform automatic failover when applications are not responsive. You can get a lot more details from section 2.2.3 of the DDS Specification or from the documentation of the different implementations (see for example this Qos Cheat-Sheet from RTI Connext DDS).\n",
      "\n",
      "Use from other Specifications\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP is primarily used by AUTOSAR for automotive applications.\n",

      "\u001b[33mcleaned_text : \u001b[0m As described in our introductory article on SOME/IP, the SOME/IP (Scalable Service-Oriented Middleware over IP) protocol is a powerful communication framework that enables seamless interaction between distributed systems over IP networks. It provides a standardized way for services to discover, connect, and exchange data with each other, making it a crucial component in modern software development.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, SOME/IP is built upon the principles of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and leverages IP-based networking to facilitate communication between various components. By utilizing the SOME/IP protocol, developers can create robust and scalable applications that can seamlessly integrate with other systems, regardless of their underlying technologies. Let us understand how SOME/IP recommends serializing the data, perform transmission of larger packets and the service discovery mechanisms in the coming sections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efficient data transfer is a crucial aspect of any communication protocol, and SOME/IP addresses this through its data serialization mechanism. Data serialization refers to the process of converting complex data structures into a format suitable for transmission over a network.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP supports direct serialization formats similar to C language data handling. By serializing data, it optimizes network bandwidth and reduces the size of the transmitted data, resulting in improved performance and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data can be either a single value (scalar) or a complex grouping of information (data structure) or a remote procedural call (RPC). SOME/IP defines the following basic data types that are used to represent scalar values.\n",
      "• boolean: An 8-bit field that can hold with 0 for False or 1 for True\n",
      "\n",
      "Following complex data types are supported in SOME/IP and are to be padded explicitly in case the elements do not align to their natural boundary.\n",
      "• struct: Predefined list of parameters. It can start with an optional length field that specifies the size of all the bytes (excluding the length field).\n",
      "• string: Contains sequence of ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16 characters. It can have fixed length (predefined) or dynamic length that begins with a big -endian encoded field specifying the length of the string.\n",
      "• array: As with C, it is a set of parameters of the same data type that can be multi-dimensional. Dynamic length array must have a length field before start of the data.\n",
      "• enumeration: An unsigned integer that can be used for custom naming purposes.\n",
      "• bitfield: An 8-, 16- or 32-bit parameter in which each bit can be individually named and is a boolean value.\n",
      "• union: A parameter that contains other parameters of different data types, that is determined at the run time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default data size is 32-bits, that is configurable, and all the size and type fields are encoded in big-endian format.\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of the SOME/IP payload depends on the transport protocol used whereby with UDP the payload can go up to about 1400 bytes - the natural boundary of the Ethernet frame. With TCP, there is no theoretical limit considering it supports segmentation of payloads by itself and hence larger sizes are automatically supported. So, when a sender wants to transmit a packet of over 1400 bytes on UDP, it can rely on the Transport Protocol mechanism defined by the SOME/IP specification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 6th bit (called the TP flag) in the Message Type field of the SOME/IP header is used to indicate if it is a segmented packet are not. If Message Type field has a value of 0x20 ORed, then it is a segmented packet and further the receiver should accumulate the subsequent packets to reassemble it. The sender thus splits a larger payload to smaller ones and sets this TP flag for all the segmented packets except the last one.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this mechanism it is possible to accommodate larger data information over UDP easily without the hassles of the TCP/IP transport overhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service Discovery in SOME/IP: Finding and Connecting to Services\n",
      "\n",
      "With a server supporting a variable number of services, it is essential to have a mechanism to identify the services available. Though these are more or less static in an automotive network, the current state of the service instances is very much needed for the client to know before consuming them. The SOME/IP Service Discovery protocol comes to the rescue for the same. SOME/IP-SD protocol is used to locate the services instances, know their current states, and perform publish/subscribe operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOME/IP-SD header looks as below:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the format is same as SOME/IP, it uses a reserved Message ID of 0xFFFF8100 for indicating it is specific to the Service Discovery protocol. The payload can have entries with optional Options array that describes the services offered/being subscribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the example below, the SD Offer specifies that it supports a service ID (0x1234) at instance (0x5678). With the options array, it specifies that this particular service is available over IPv4 address 192.168.29.93 at UDP port 30509.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this, the server actively sends the Offer messages over multicast with the list of available services to the client so that they can connect to it and consume them.In some cases, the client might not have received the Offer, or it may want to explicitly know the current service offerings from the service. In this case, the client sends the Find service for which the server responds with Offer.When the service becomes unavailable, the server sends the Stop Offer over multicast for the clients to know.The client, based on the Offer received, can subscribe to a particular set of services by sending the Subscribe message to the relevant event group.If the server can service the Subscribe request from the client, it acknowledges the same with SubscribeAck message and then publishes the events as requested.If for some reason, the server cannot provide the Subscribe service to the client, it sends a negative acknowledgment to the client indicating the same.When a client no longer needs data from the event group, it can send a Stop Subscribe message to the server to unsubscribe from the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether it is a server or client, implementing the SOME/IP protocol in your application requires careful consideration of various factors and best practices. Here are some key steps to follow:\n",
      "• Define Service Interfaces: Clearly define the interfaces for your services, including the methods, fields, and events they support.\n",
      "• Implement Serialization: Carefully follow the serialization format, considering factors such as data complexity, alignment, and throughput.\n",
      "• Implement Communication Handlers: Develop the necessary communication handlers for sending and receiving SOME/IP messages, taking into account the supported methods and events.\n",
      "• Integrate Service Discovery: Incorporate the service discovery mechanism into your application, allowing services to dynamically discover and connect to each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can successfully implement the SOME/IP protocol in your application, enabling seamless communication and interoperability with other systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SOME/IP services supported by the server can be specified using the ARXML and FIBEX formats so that any third-party tools/client can consume it.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the SOME/IP protocol is a comprehensive and powerful middleware framework that enables seamless communication between distributed systems over IP networks. By understanding its key features, message structure, and implementation best practices, developers can harness the power of SOME/IP to build scalable, flexible, and efficient automotive applications.\n",

      "\u001b[34mmeta_description : \u001b[0m Learn about Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME IP) protocol for automotive use-cases.\n",
      "\u001b[33mcleaned_text : \u001b[0m Today’s automobiles are not just a means of commuting and transportation; the vehicles are now designed feature-packed to make the journey a luxury experience. All of this comes by integrating sophisticated electronics with the vehicle’s ECU (Engine Control Unit). This new scenario has significantly changed how data communicate among different units of ECU. Traditional automotive protocols like CAN, MOST, LIN, and Flexray are signal-based communication protocols, and these protocols have some notable limitations, as mentioned below.\n",
      "• Traditional Protocols like CAN, LIN, MOST, and Flexray have limited bandwidth.\n",
      "• These protocols are only suitable for static systems that do not have any software upgrade or update in their lifetime.\n",
      "• In these protocols, data is communicated between the sender and the receiver whenever there is an event (like the reception of an interrupt). The receiver may not need the data in response to every event. Therefore, these protocols always have a data overhead in the communication channel, which cannot be avoided or managed in any way.\n",
      "• Traditional Protocols like CAN, LIN, MOST, and Flexray, being signal-based communication protocols, do not ensure interoperability among different operating systems, embedded firmware, data interfaces, and application software.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of the limitations mentioned above of traditional automotive communication protocols, in 2011, BMW group introduced a middleware protocol for data communication among various heterogeneous units of any ECU, the Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP). As the name itself indicates, this protocol is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalable: This protocol is designed for scalability and interoperability among heterogeneous devices with different hardware platforms, different operating systems or embedded firmware, and different application software.\n",
      "\n",
      "service-Oriented: It is a service-oriented protocol. Therefore, the data is exchanged in a client-server configuration only when requested by a client or notified by the server to the particular subscribers. This ensures that the bandwidth is never wasted and data is communicated/exchanged only when and where required.\n",
      "\n",
      "MiddlewarE: This is a middleware protocol, i.e., it lies in the application layer and has its own general-purpose protocol layers to deal with more specific operations and applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "over IP: This is an Ethernet-based protocol. It uses a similar hardware interface, ensuring a bandwidth of up to 100Mbps. The data is communicated over the middleware, i.e., the application layer, over the network cable using TCP/IP or UDP protocols. When the client requires the data from the server, it is requested by the client using the TCP protocol. If the server must communicate the data to all the active subscribers, it is transmitted over UDP protocol. The data communication over UDP protocol can be unicast, multicast, or broadcast.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOME/IP was initially developed as another RPC mechanism to ensure compatibility with AUTOSAR devices and provide the maximum features required by automotive use-cases. It is a network layer protocol designed specifically for inter-ECU client-server serialization. At present, the protocol can be implemented over several different operating systems, including AUTOSAR, OSEK, and GENIVI. It can also be implemented on embedded firmware running no operating system. Devices such as cameras, head units, telematics devices, AUTOSAR devices, and even large devices like infotainment systems, can efficiently exchange inter-ECU messages using SOME/IP protocol. SOME/IP support has been public since the release of Wireshark 3.2 SOME/IP that can be accessed at Wireshark.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features of SOME/IP protocol\n",
      "\n",
      " SOME/IP is a network layer protocol that works as a middleware, i.e., logically implemented in the application layer. As a middleware, SOME/IP can provide many different applications/features as different general-purpose protocol layers. Some of the key features/applications of SOME/IP are following.\n",
      "\n",
      "Serialization: The protocol takes care of transforming inter-ECU messages into and from on-wire representations. At the wire-format level, the protocol is compatible with the AUTOSAR 4.x standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and Messaging: The protocol can communicate messages (sent as fields) as well as the remote invocation of methods (implement procedure/function calls).\n",
      "\n",
      "Service Discovery: The data communication using SOME/IP protocol happens in a client-server arrangement. SOME/IP is based on a service-oriented architecture. The server provides many different services to which client devices can subscribe. The protocol allows clients to dynamically find services, subscribe to them, and configure their access to the services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Publish/Subscribe: The data communication in SOME/IP takes place through publish/subscribe. The clients can subscribe to services provided by the server, and the server can publish notifications to the active subscribers. This allows dynamic configuration between the client devices and the server. With publish/subscribe arrangement, the server can selectively communicate data to the clients requiring specific inter-ECU messages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segmentation of UDP messages: Whenever notifications have to be sent to active subscribers by the server, they are sent over UDP protocol. SOME/IP is capable of communicating large UDP messages without the need for any fragmentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "How SOME/IP protocol works\n",
      "\n",
      " All data communication in SOME/IP protocol is performed in the form of services. The server ECU provides the services. The client devices can dynamically find services offered by the server (Service Discovery), subscribe to the services, and perform configuration to access subscribed services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The services are a combination of fields, events, and/or methods. A field represents the status of an entity and can be a notifier, getter, or setter. A Notifier is a field sent from server to client on change of a value. A Getter is a field sent by the client to the server for explicitly querying a value. A Setter is a field sent by the client to the server to change/modify a value explicitly. Event is a message communicated from the server to the client when a value is changed or cyclically communicated to clients. Method is a (programming) function/procedure/subroutine that can be invoked. A method is run on the server on remote invocation from the client.\n",
      "\n",
      "A service provides an interface, and a single instance of a service implementing a service interface is called Service Instance. The service instance is provided by the server ECU that implements a service interface. The client ECU can use a service instance to get the required data (fields, events, and methods) from the server ECU.\n",
      "\n",
      "The client devices know about the available services, i.e., available service instances using a service discovery protocol. The service discovery protocol has two mechanisms to convey the availability of services – ‘Offer Service’ and ‘Find Service’. When the server ECU communicates the available services to the network (all the client ECUs), the mechanism is called ‘Offer Service’. When the clients request available services from the server ECU, the mechanism is called ‘Find Service’. Therefore, the discovery of available services within the network can be initiated from both server ECU as well as client ECUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once services required by a client are discovered using either mechanism, it can subscribe to those service instances. For subscription, the client needs to send a Subscribe Eventgroup to the server. The server checks the validation of the subscription request and, if found correct, sends back a positive acknowledgment. It is possible that multiple clients may subscribe to a given service instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data communicated between server and client can be a scalar value, a complex data structure, or a function invocation (RPC). The following scalar data types are supported in SOME/IP –\n",
      "\n",
      "boolean: This has an 8-bit field containing False (0) or True (1). No other values are allowed in boolean type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following complex data types are supported in SOME/IP –\n",
      "\n",
      "struct: It is a predefined list of parameters. A struct starts with an optional length field indicating all the bytes following the length field.\n",
      "\n",
      "string: Character strings containing ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16 characters. The strings can have fixed length or dynamic length. The dynamic length strings begin with an endian field indicating the length of the string.\n",
      "\n",
      "array: A set of parameters of the same data type. Arrays can be one-dimensional as well as multi-dimensional. The length of the array can be fixed or dynamic. The dynamic length array begins with a length field.\n",
      "\n",
      "enumeration: It is an unsigned integer indicating different values by its bits.\n",
      "\n",
      "bitfield: It is an 8-, 16- or 32-bit parameter in which each bit is a boolean value.\n",
      "\n",
      "union/variant: It is a parameter that contains other parameters of different data types.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data is communicated between server ECU and client ECU over UDP or TCP protocols. UDP protocol is used when data needs to be sent by the server to all the active subscribers (like in the case of notifier fields and events). The data transfer using UDP can be via unicast, multicast, or broadcast. When data needs to be sent by the client to the server (like in the case of getter fields, setter fields, and RPC), the client needs to establish a connection with the server using TCP protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "In SOME/IP, there are four methods for remote procedure calls (RPC) as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Request/Response method: In this method, a request for calling a function is sent by the client to the server, and the server sends back a response to the client. The response can be a positive acknowledgment or an error message. The function is run on the server ECU at request from a client ECU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fire and Forget method: In this method, the client sends a request for calling a function to the server, and the server does not communicate any response to the client.\n",
      "\n",
      "Services-Event: Event is a message communicated from the server to the client when a value is changed or cyclically communicated to clients. The server notifies the change in a value only to the clients who have subscribed for that service. The notification is sent every time the event occurs, i.e., the value related to the subscribed service is changed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Services-Field: A field is a property/attribute of service. It can be a notifier, getter, or setter. Getter is a method to read a field value, and Setter is a method to change a field value. Notifier is a notification event triggered by a change of a field value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data (fields, events, and methods) are transferred in protocol data units (PDUs) as TCP/UDP messages payloads. The TCP/UDP messages are transported over an IP-based in-vehicle network enabling inter-ECU data communication. A header precedes the payload. For ensuring inter-operability, the header layout is identical for all implementations of SOME/IP. The header consists of a 32-bit Message ID, 32-bit Length Field, 32-bit Request ID/Session ID, 8-bit Protocol Version/8-bit Interface Version/8-bit Message Type/8-bit Return Code. Hence, a TCP/UDP data packet communicated over SOME/IP protocol has the following PDUs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advantages of SOME/IP Protocol\n",
      "\n",
      " SOME/IP protocol has many advantages compared to traditional automotive protocols like CAN, LIN, and MOST. Some of the worth-noting advantages of SOME/IP are the following:\n",
      "• Being a service-oriented protocol, it is interoperable and scalable. New parameters and functions can be easily added to a vehicle system using SOME/IP. Only the header layout must be identical in all implementations of SOME/IP within a network.\n",
      "• SOME/IP offers great flexibility for all types of data communication in a closely coupled inter-ECU ecosystem by providing communication of scalar data values to complex data structures.\n",
      "• SOME/IP provides large bandwidth for data communication in the range of 100Mbps and takes care of not wasting the bandwidth at all by providing all data communications in a client-server configuration.\n",
      "• SOME/IP allows the implementation of complicated service interfaces by supporting many different data types and multiple RPC mechanisms.\n",
      "• The data from the server ECU can be communicated to client ECU via unicast, multicast, and broadcast.\n",
      "• Being a middleware, it is suitable even for CPU-intensive applications.\n",
      "• SOME/IP can be implemented on many automotive operating systems and even embedded firmware with no operating system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      " Automobiles are now essentially feature-packed with sophisticated heterogeneous electronic devices included in the vehicle ECU. These features include infotainment systems, driver assistance, cameras, diagnostics, navigation, and internet applications. Such diverse applications need a flexible, interoperable, and scalable network layer protocol that allows easy value-addition to a vehicle ecosystem despite different hardware and software environments. SOME/IP, a service-oriented protocol built over Ethernet, is perfect for the new automotive use-cases. Being compatible with AUTOSAR 4.x standard and compatibility with other automotive operating systems and non-OS firmware makes SOME/IP the best choice for automotive software. The inter-ECU data communication has never been so flexible and scalable until the SOME/IP network protocol development.\n"

      "SOMEIP is an automotive middleware solution that can be used for control messages It was designed from beginning on to fit devices of different sizes and different operating systems perfectly This includes small devices like cameras AUTOSAR devices and up to head units or telematics devices It was also made sure that SOMEIP supports features of the Infotainment domain as well as that of other domains in the vehicle allowing SOMEIP to be used for MOST replacement scenarios as well as more traditional CAN scenarios Scalable ServiceOriented Middleware over IP SOMEIP is a communication middleware in the automotive sector which is used in AUTOSAR among other things SOMEIP is the only solution that has supported both AUTOSAR platforms since the beginning of the Adaptive Platform This makes SOMEIP very widely used as middleware for Ethernet communication in vehicles Publications on SOMEIP have been published since 2011 as part of the BMBFfunded SEIS project The first AUTOSAR specifications from SOMEIP were published in 2013 as part of the Classic Platform version 41 Components of SOMEIP SOMEIP itself comprises several core components SOMEIP Serialization and message exchange SOMEIPSD Service Discovery SD and PublishSubscribe SOMEIPTP Transport Protocol TP for segmenting large messages The SOMEIP serialization was highly optimized for resource requirements in order to manage with few memory and CPU resources Therefore a binary and nondescriptive form of serialization was used Later an incompatible proprietary extension to a TLV like serialization was defined This extension attempts to achieve more flexibility through a TLVlike serialization at the expense of the resource requirements of the serialization Basics SOMEIP is based on serviceoriented communication Control units act as both clients and servers and can therefore offer socalled services themselves or request services from other control units In contrast to signaloriented data transmission messages are only sent when required The advantage here is the significantly reduced bus load However this type of transmission requires that a server knows about every client that has requested something A client can use a SOMEIPSD message to subscribe to a service ie to show a need for a service The server can confirm this request either positively or negatively If the confirmation is positive the server saves the clients connection data and can inform the client if necessary A client can find out which services are offered within its network in two ways Using a SOMEIPSD Find Service message it can actively search the network for certain services If a server offers this service it can respond In addition a server can use SOMEIPSD Offer Service messages to broadcast the services it offers to all clients The participants clients thus passively receive the services offered in the network A client can also send requests to a server without a subscription In contrast to subscribed content where the client usually wants to receive an automatic response every time the data changes the client here requires a direct onetime response Requests that do not require a response are also possible 2 SOMEIP is the first protocol in the automotive sector that does not use the classic approach of signalbased communication such as CAN LIN FlexRay or MOST Service Discovery The SOMEIPSD Service Discovery protocol regulates the provision of services and the sending of events It was designed to ensure efficient unicast communication using SOMEIP This can minimize data traffic on the bus and reduce the overall load To ensure these requirements Service Discovery includes the following set of messages that can be sent 3 Find Service finds a service instance Offer Service publishes a service instance Stop Offer Service stops the availability of a service instance Subscribe Eventgroup subscribes to the events and fields of an event group Stop Subscribe Eventgroup stops a Subscribe Eventgroup entry Subscribe Eventgroup Ack confirms a Subscribe Eventgroup entry Subscribe Eventgroup Nack rejects a Subscribe Eventgroup entry Embassies SOMEIP A SOMEIP message can be separated into a header and a payload Within the payload data can be in TypeLengthValue format or LengthValue format Headers The header contains the following information 32bit message ID that assigns the message to a specific service and method 32bit length field containing the length in bytes of the following information 32bit request ID which assigns the message to a client and a session ID 8bit protocol version 8bit interface version 8bit message type which includes a distinction between the different message types 8bit return code which indicates whether a request was processed correctly Payload A SOMEIP payload consists of data in TLV format Both complex data types and simple data types can be used The following simple data types can be used boolean 8 bit field which can only take values of 0 False or 1 True uint8 unsigned integer with 8 bit size uint16 unsigned integer with 16 bit size uint32 unsigned integer with 32 bit size uint64 unsigned integer with 64 bit size sint8 signed integer with 8 bit size sint16 signed integer with 16 bit size sint32 signed integer with 32 bit size sint64 signed integer with 64 bit size float32 floating point numbers with 32 bit size float64 floating point numbers with 64 bit size The following complex data types can be used struct A data structure that contains a predefined number of additional complex andor simple data types string Character string typically containing data in ASCII UTF8 or UTF16 format Dynamic length strings include a length field at the beginning array A data structure that only contains elements of the same type It can be a static array with a fixed length or a dynamic array with a variable length A length field is used for dynamic arrays enumeration an uint with the option of naming different values bitfield 8 16 or 32bit parameter where each bit value represents a Boolean value union A parameter that can be interpreted as different data types at the same time The tag in TLV format in AUTOSAR consists of a wire type the data ID and a potential length field If it is a simple data type wire type 03 the length field can be omitted since the length of the data type is already defined by the wire type itself The following wire types are defined Wire Type Following Data 0 8 Bit Data Base Datatype 1 16 Bit Data Base Datatype 2 32 Bit Data Base Datatype 3 64 Bit Data Base Datatype 4 Complex Data Type Array Struct String Union with length field of static size configured in data definition 5 Complex Data Type Array Struct String Union with length field size 1 byte ignore static definition 6 Complex Data Type Array Struct String Union with length field size 2 byte ignore static definition 7 Complex Data Type Array Struct String Union with length field size 4 byte ignore static definition SOMEIPSD Service Discovery is based on the SOMEIP protocol and uses the header elements of the SOMEIP header already mentioned with the exception of the message ID and the length field This is followed by a 1byte field with various flags The following 3 bytes are reserved and not used Entry arrays are present in the payload The number of these is defined by a preceding length field This is followed by an options array also with a preceding length field Two types can occur in entry arrays one for services and one for event groups An entry array element for services contains the following fields 8bit type which can accept either Find 0x00 or Offer 0x01 8bit index containing the first index in the options entry for the first pass 8bit index containing the first index in the options entry for the second pass 4bits number of options 1st pass 4bit number of options 2nd pass 16bit service ID 16bit instance ID 16bit major version 24Bit Time To Live 32bit minor version An entry array element for event groups contains the following fields 8bit type which can accept either SubscribeEventgroupStopSubscribeEventgroup 0x06 or SubscribeEventgroupNackSubscribeEventgroupAck 0x07 8bit index containing the first index in the options entry for the first pass 8bit index containing the first index in the options entry for the second pass 4bits number of options 1st pass 4bit number of options 2nd pass 16bit service ID 16bit instance ID 16bit major version 24Bit Time To Live 16bits Reserved 16bit event group ID An option array can contain additional information for the individual entries It contains the following elements 8bit length field containing the length in bytes of the configuration string 4bit type with static value 0x01 4 bits reserved with static value 0x00 Null terminated configuration string A configuration string contains elements that correspond to the format LengthKeyValue The string is terminated with a length field of the value 0 which specifies no subsequent elements Scalable serviceOriented MiddlewarE over IP SOMEIP Overview SOMEIP is an automotive middleware solution that can be used for control messages It was designed from beginning on to fit devices of different sizes and different operating systems perfectly This includes small devices like cameras AUTOSAR devices and up to head units or telematics devices It was also made sure that SOMEIP supports features of the Infotainment domain as well as that of other domains in the vehicle allowing SOMEIP to be used for MOST replacement scenarios as well as more traditional CAN scenarios SOMEIP supports a wide range of middleware features Serialization transforming into and from onwire representation Remote Procedure Call RPC and Messaging implementing remote invocation of functions as well as other messages Service Discovery SD dynamically finding and functionality and configuring its access PublishSubscribe PubSub dynamically configuring which data is needed and shall be sent to the client Segmentation of UDP messages allowing the transport of large SOMEIP messages over UDP without the need of fragmentation Serialization The SOMEIP serialization was designed to be highly efficient ie it uses the minimal RAM and CPU resources This is achieved by using a binary and nondescriptive format Basically all parameters are written behind each other The format of a message is very similar or many cases exactly the same as the inmemory representation of the message packed struct SOMEIP can serialize the following basic datatypes datatypes are encoded per default in network byte orderbig endian but can also encoded in little endian boolean an 8bit field encoding False 0 or True 1 All other values are not allowed to be used uint8 unsigned integer with 8 bit size uint16 unsigned integer with 16 bit size uint32 unsigned integer with 32 bit size uint64 unsigned integer with 64 bit size sint8 signed integer with 8 bit size sint16 signed integer with 16 bit size sint32 signed integer with 32 bit size sint64 signed integer with 64 bit size float32 floating point numbers with 32 bit size float64 floating point numbers with 64 bit size SOMEIP can serialize the following complex datatypes struct a parameter that combines a predefined list of parameters A struct can start with an optional length field counting all bytes of the struct following the length field string fixed length or dynamic length character strings transporting ascii UTF8 or UTF16 characters For dynamic length strings the string starts with a bigendian encoded length field counting the bytes the string characters use array a parameter that contains a repetition of the same parameter type This can be predefined number or dynamic number of parameters For arrays with dynamic length a length field is used enumeration an uint with the option of naming different values bitfield 8 16 or 32bit parameter with each bit representing a boolean Each boolean can have a name as well as a name for the True and False value each union a parameter that can carry a parameter of a predefined parameter type which is determined at the runtime The serialization uses a length field type field and the data of the parameter The size of length and type fields is 32 bit default and be be configured to be 0 8 16 or 32 bit All length and type fields are encoded in network byte orderbigendian Remote Procedure Call RPC and Messaging SOMEIP services support the following messages RequestResponse Methods A request sent from a client to the server and a response sent back from server to client Additionally SOMEIP allows error responses to be sent back from server to client instead of the regular response This feature might be used to implement a different payload format in error cases Fire and Forget Methods A request is sent from a client to the server Event An event is sent from the server to a relevant clients Which client needs this event will be determined via SOMEIPSD Field A field can have an option notifier event to be sent cyclically or onchange an optional setter a requestresponse method to update the field and an optional getter a requestresponse method to read out the current value of the field Proprietary extension to the SOMEIP serialization SOMEIP already supports a lot of flexibility in the serilization of messages like adding parameters to messages or inside structs later A proprietary extension wrongly called a TLV extension at first was added to SOMEIP in later AUTOSAR releases to support even more flexibility Basically parameters andor struct members can be prefixed with an Data ID and Length Indication While this makes the serialization much less efficient it adds flexibility like removing parameters from messages or reordering parameters later To use this feature APIs and applications need to support this too Due to the limited flexiblity and the high overhead this extension is currently NOT widely used Keep in mind that not all SOMEIP implementation support this extension since its not part of the original SOMEIP AUTOSAR support SOMEIP is the only known middleware that was designed to be integrated into AUTOSAR 4x releases AUTOSAR 40 basic support for SOMEIP messages already existing AUTOSAR 41 support for SOMEIPSD and PublishSubscribe was added AUTOSAR 42 the transformer was added for serialization as well as other optimizations AUTOSAR 43 fixing some transformer bugs adding support for large UDP messages with SOMEIPTP as well as SOMEIPSD

Krebs Dr Lars Vlker Nov 2011 First public release Automotive Network Security Overview Automotive Network Security uses mostly known standards to protect communication inside the vehicle Protocols like SSLTLS IPsec and MACsec are also used in other industries and some additional automotivespecific solutions like SecOC exist The main difference between Network Security in vehicles and most other areas are in special aspects like the startup time of the solutions While in most industries the startup of a security solution may take seconds without problems in the automotive use cases a startup in a few milliseconds is required This ECU and Network Test Specification is designed to determine if a product conforms to specifications defined in OPEN Specification s or related requirements This specification is a collection of all test cases which are recommend to be considered for automotive use and should be referred by car manufacturers within their quality control processes Sucessful execution and passing all relevant tests gives a De vice Under Test DUT a mimimum approval that the devices basic implementiations are done correctly This Test specification document is grouped in several chapters oriented on the scopes Automotive Ethernet TCPIP Protocol Family and Automotive P rotocols which are described in chapter 13 Tests are organized and identified with distinct IDs that

TCP, on the other hand, guarantees that data will be delivered in the correct order, ensuring reliability but at the cost of potentially higher latency.\n",
